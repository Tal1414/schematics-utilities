At the moment, none of the utility functions from the Angular Schematics package are exported.

This project was created from that purpose - _providing a collection of general and useful utilities for Schematics, based on non-exported existing functions and further_.

## How to Install

To Install using npm, simply do:

```
npm install schematics-utilities
```
