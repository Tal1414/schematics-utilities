At the moment, none of the utility functions from the Angular Schematics package are exported.

This project was created from that purpose - _providing a collection of general and useful utilities for Schematics, based on non-exported existing functions and further_.

## How to Install

To Install using npm, simply do:

```
npm install schematics-utilities
```

## How to Use

```javascript
import { Rule, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';
// 1. Import the needed utilities
import { addPackageJsonDependency, NodeDependency, NodeDependencyType } from 'schematics-utilities';

function addDependencies(host: Tree): Tree {
  const dependencies: NodeDependency[] = [
    { type: NodeDependencyType.Default, version: '^2.5.2', name: 'typescript' }
  ];

  // 2. Just use it whenever you need :)
  dependencies.forEach(dependency => addPackageJsonDependency(host, dependency));

  return host;
}

export default function(): Rule {
  return (tree: Tree) => {
    addDependencies(tree);

    return tree;
  };
}
```
